## 1. **DOM Manipulation**

### Previous Code
- **Uses `appendChild`:**
  - Each row and cell are created as individual DOM elements using `document.createElement`.
  - Elements are appended to the table body one by one.
  - This involves multiple DOM operations: creating and appending rows and cells in separate steps.

## 2. **Loop Type**

### Previous Code
- **`forEach` loop:**
  - Iterates through the `employees` array in a declarative, callback-based manner.
  - Each iteration constructs and appends individual DOM elements.

## 3. **Performance**

### Previous Code
- **Multiple `appendChild` calls:**
  - Each `appendChild` operation updates the DOM, which can be resource-intensive, especially for large datasets.
  - Fine-grained manipulation is possible since each cell is a separate DOM element.

## 4. **Readability**

 **Explicit and verbose:**
  - Each element is created, configured, and appended separately, making it easy to understand the structure of the DOM.
  - Useful if additional logic needs to be applied to each element (e.g., adding event listeners).
